=== jfPHP.Core ===

jfPHP.Core is free framework developed for PHP 5.3. This program includes 
classes and interfaces to solve standard problems. The minimalism of this framework is its strength, 
software components can be implemented over the project while maintaining a degree of modularity.

The project is featured on my blog, documentation and tutorials (in french) are available.
If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment in my blog.
